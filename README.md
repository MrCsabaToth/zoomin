Magnifying glass software for UI designers to inspect graphics pixel-by-pixel

This software is based on an old Microsoft SDK sample program, it's extended with gridline and hairline capabilities and other handy features, such as:
* Multi-monitor handling! (this was the original goal of the program)
* Optional auto-update from the magnified area
* Drawing methods
* DriectDraw hardware accelerated mode is not functional at this moment, but can be enabled
